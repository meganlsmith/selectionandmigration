# Simple Models

First we consider a set of models with constant mutation rates, constant recombination rates, and relatively simple DFEs.

## Demographic models
1. No migration (nomig)
2. Migration 1 -> 2 (p1_p2)
3. Migration 2 -> 1 (p2_p1)

## Distributions of Fitness Effects
1. Neutral ([neutral-nomig](https://github.com/meganlsmith/selectionandmigration/blob/main/docs/scripts/slim/simple/nomig_neutral_scaled.slim), [neutral-p1_p2](https://github.com/meganlsmith/selectionandmigration/blob/main/docs/scripts/slim/simple/p1_p2_neutral_scaled.slim), [neutral-p2_p1](https://github.com/meganlsmith/selectionandmigration/blob/main/docs/scripts/slim/simple/p2_p1_neutral_scaled.slim))
2. Simple Background Selection
3. Selective Sweeps
4. Adaptive Introgression
