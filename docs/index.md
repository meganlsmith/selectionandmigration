This is a project page for understanding the impacts of selection on inferences of migration.

# Simulations in SLiM
We considered several different models, all implemented in SLiM, tskit, and pyslim. First, we considered a set of relatively simple models that differed in DFE and the presence or absense of gene flow. Then, we considered complex models with more realistic DFEs, recombination maps, and mutation rate variation.
