# Simulations in SLiM

## [SLiM models](slim.md)
We considered several different models, all implemented in SLiM and msprime. First, we considered a set of relatively simple models that differed in DFE and the presence or absense of gene flow. Then, we considered complex models with more realistic DFEs, recombination maps, and mutation rate variation.
