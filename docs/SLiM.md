# SLiM Models

We considered several different models, all implemented in SLiM and msprime. First, we considered a set of relatively sipmle models that differed in DFE and the presence or absense of gene flow. Then, we considered complex models with more realistic DFEs, recombination maps, and mutation rate variation.
